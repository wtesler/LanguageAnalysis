How long until it's ready
Haven't I seen you before
Is it going to be a long time
Don't we need to pay with cash
Isn't that the best
Does the hamburger come with a coke
Which way to the store
Is the inside open
Can that feed two
fries have salt on them
We want to know if you're still open
What will it cost me
What did you say
Can you repeat that
Am I speaking to a robot
Are you real
Am I too late to order french toast
They wanted to know if we can get that to go
Isn't that expensive
How expensive it is
Why can't we pull up to the front
Visa is accepted
Hamburgers are all natural
Are you going to reimburse us for that
Are you the manager

Could you add fries to that order
Would you cut that in half
Could you cut that in half for me
Is it possible to cut that in half
When does the store close on Saturdays
